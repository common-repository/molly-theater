A lightweight video player plugin for Vimeo or Youtube videos in a fullscreen player.

== Description ==

Use the Molly Theater plugin to create an easy-to-use and responsive fullscreen player for your Vimeo or Youtube videos. Get rid of the standard static width embeds and upgrade your website's video experience.

**To use.** All you have to do is add a data-attribute with a Vimeo or Youtube value to an element on your page, and Molly Theater does the rest.

**Design.** Make anything a button for your video. Any element you put the data-attribute on becomes a clickable button, opening your full-screen video.

= Features =
* Lightweight and efficient code
* Responsive fullscreen player
* Thorough Documentation under Tools
* CSS Documentation for total control and customization

= Custom Fields = 
[Advanced Custom Fields](https://www.advancedcustomfields.com) can be used very effectively to dynamically place the Vimeo and Youtube IDs.

= Links =
* [Documentation](https://meetmolly.dev/)

== Installation ==
 
From your WordPress dashboard

1. **Visit** Plugins > Add New
2. **Search** for "Molly Theater"
3. **Activate** Molly Theater from your Plugins page
4. **Use** by adding a data attribute of either `data-molly-video-vimeo` or `data-molly-video-youtube` containing either the Vimeo ID (a string of numbers, e.g. '87530837') or a Youtube ID (an alpha-numeric string, e.g. 'AajP933wMUo')
